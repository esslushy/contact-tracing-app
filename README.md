# Contact Tracing App
Based on https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf.  

This is my recreation of the practices described in the paper above in React Native. It is a WIP and still needs some work for the Bluetooth engine, but I have not abandoned this app, I am simply taking a break at the moment to focus on school. This was initially a project for my engineering class for app development, but I will continue this on my own.
